# Data from EPA Green House Gas Reporting program
In this project, the two team member 
- conducted research on the historical Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) emissions data from direct emitters with respect to three 
features (company, sector and state); 
- applied Feature Engineering and used three Linear Regression models to predict Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) emissions 
in a given facility in a given year, and added them to calculate the total CO2e emission nationwide.
